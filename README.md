# Xamarin.Forms team hackathon 2020 project to create VS Code tooling prototype

Project Goals:

* Create a dedicated Xamarin extension that adds an emulator view, XAML IntelliSense, create new project and debugging experience in VS Code
* Create an extension pack that bundles together multiple extensions to create the full experience (C#, new Xamarin extension, etc.)
* Create a landing page experience for new Xamarin projects that provides helpful links and UI instructional overlay

All the above experiences should work on both Windows and Mac

**Debug experience**

* Build and launch the app on the emulator
* Locals, Stacks, breakpoints, etc.
